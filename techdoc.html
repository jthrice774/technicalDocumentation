<section id="Type-6_Shuttlecraft" class="main-section" value="Type-6_Shuttlecraft"><header>Type-6 Shuttlecraft</header>
<p>The <a href="https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Type-6_shuttlecraft">Type-6 shuttlecraft</a> was a Federation Starfleet shuttlecraft type in service in the 24th century. Due to their size compared to other shuttlecraft, type-6 shuttlecraft were sometimes referred to as personnel carriers.
</p><p>The type-6 was designed as a short-range warpshuttle and was classified as a "light" shuttle (as compared to the type-7 shuttlecraft's classification as a "medium" shuttle). It was furthermore equipped with an atmospheric airscoop for atmospheric flight and hover field antigravs. The shuttle also featured a navigational deflector and redundant graviton polarity source generators. A transporter assembly was also not standard, but the shuttle could be fitted with a portable array.</p><p>Entry to the shuttle was through a large hatch in the rear of the vessel. The hatch could be opened via a control pad next to the impulse engines. There were benches for passenger seating in the aft section and ample room for cargo. A separate systems display was also found in the aft area, as were storage bins.</p>

<section id="Type-7_Shuttlecraft" class="main-section"><header>Type-7 Shuttlecraft</header>
<p>The <a href="https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Type-7_shuttlecraft">Type-7 shuttlecraft</a> (also known as the S20-class) was a Federation Starfleet shuttlecraft type in service from the mid-2350s through the 2370s. Due to their size compared to other shuttlecraft, Type-7 shuttlecraft are used as administrative shuttles and sometimes referred to as personnel shuttles.</p><p>The Type-7 was designed as a short-range warpshuttle and was classified as a 'medium' shuttle (as compared to the Type-6 shuttlecraft's classification as a 'light' shuttle). It was equipped with emergency transporters, which could be reconfigured for use as standard transporters if necessary.</p><p>The forward cockpit contained two seats, each with a small console and a view out the shuttlecraft window. In the center of the cockpit was a large display which gave navigational information and acted as a viewscreen. The aft area had passenger seating and sensor control. </p>

<section id="Type-10_Shuttlecraft" class="main-section"><header>Type-10 Shuttlecraft</header>
<p>The <a href="https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Type-10_shuttlecraft">Type-10 shuttlecraft</a> was a United Federation of Planets shuttlecraft that was introduced in 2373. They were designed for use with Defiant-class starships. These shuttlecraft were the successor to the Type-6 shuttlecraft.</p><p>The Type-10's power grid made no use of antimatter, enabling it to safely enter areas of subspace metreon radiation where another vessel would suffer catastrophic warp core damage.</p><p>The Type-10 had a stronger hull than the Type-8 shuttlecraft and could polarize its hull plating. It also came equipped with micro-photon torpedoes.</p>

<section id="Type-11_Shuttlecraft" class="main-section"><header>Type-11 Shuttlecraft</header>
<p>The <a href="https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Type-11_shuttlecraft">Type-11 shuttlecraft</a> was a type of Federation shuttlecraft that had been introduced into Starfleet service by the mid-2370s decade.</p><p>At 16 meters long, the Type-11 was one of the larger shuttles in use by Starfleet. They were fitted with warp drive and had ejectable warp cores. Some were designed to be reconfigurable for multi-mission profiles, and could be outfitted as aquashuttles. This entailed lowering and reconfiguring the warp nacelles to act as pontoons, and fitting stabilizing fins, linear induction thrusters, searchlights, undersea sensor arrays and tractor beam emitters, and extra structural integrity field generators.</p>

<section id="Type-15_Shuttlepod" class="main-section"><header>Type-15 Shuttlepod</header>
<p>The <a href="https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Type-15_shuttlepod">Type-15 Shuttlepod</a> was a small Federation shuttlecraft in operation in the late 24th century. The main production base for these light short-range sublight craft was Starbase 134's Integration Facility at Rigel VI.</p><p>In its standard configuration, the Type-15 shuttlepod could accomodate two crewmembers, a pilot and a systems manager. It was equipped with two 500 millicochrane impulse engines which gave it a maximum speed of 12,800 meters per second, eight DeFI 657 hot gas RCS thrusters and three sarium krellide storage cells. It had a mass of 0.86 metric tonnes.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Type-16_shuttlepod">Type-16 shuttlepod</a> was a Federation shuttlepod, a medium short-range vessel. These shuttlepods were upsized versions of the Type-15 shuttlepod.</p><p>The Type-16 was primarily built at Starbase 134's Integration Facility at planet Rigel VI in the 2360s decade. These craft had a mass of 1.25 metric tonnes, and were powered by two 750 millicochrane impulse driver engines, with four sarium krellide battery cells, and 8 DeFl 635 hot gas reaction control system thrusters.</p>

<section id="Type-17_Shuttlecraft" class="main-section"><header>Type-17 Shuttlecraft</header>
<p>The <a href="https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Type-17_shuttlecraft">Type-17 shuttle</a> was a 24th century Federation auxiliary craft class, a heavy cargo shuttle/cargo shuttle/heavy transport/shuttlecraft in Starfleet service from the 2370s decade.</p><p>The Type-17 had an advanced design. Its conformal warp nacelles were enclosed within the shuttle's hull. Fold-up wings were an innovative feature to improve atmospheric flight. The Type-17 was designated a heavy cargo shuttle, heavy transport, or cargo shuttle, and intended for orbital transport of materials when beaming was unavailable or inadvisable.</p>

<section id="Warp_Drive" class="main-section"><header>Warp Drive</header>
<p><a href="https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Warp_drive">Warp drive</a> is the primary propulsive force behind most advanced space vessels, propelling them faster than the speed of light. The drive does this by generating warp fields to form a subspace bubble that envelops the starship, distorting the local spacetime continuum immediately around the ship and moving the starship at superluminal velocities. These velocities are referred to as warp factors.</p><p>
The scale used by Starfleet in the 22nd and 23rd century is based on a geometric progression, where the speed of a vessel (measured in multiples of c, the speed of light) is equal to the cube of the given warp factor. The warp factor was calculated as follows:<br><br>
<code>wf=vc√3</code>
<br>with</p><ul>
<li>v being the speed of the signal or starship</li>
<li>c being the speed of light (3.0 × 108 m/s) and</li>
<li>wf being the resulting warp factor</li>
</ul><p>
Or, to calculate speed (v) in terms of c, the formula would be: <br><br>
<code>v=wf3c</code>
<code>v=wf3c</code>
<br><br>
At warp 1, a starship would reach c; at warp 6, it would reach 216 c.</p>
<p>The warp factor scale used by Starfleet in the 24th century was based on a recalibration of the scale used in the Original Series. Rather than a simple geometric progression based on relative speed, warp factors were established to be based upon the amount of power required to transition from one warp plateau to another. For example, the power to initially get to warp factor 1 was much more than the power required to maintain it; likewise warp 2, 3, 4, and so on. Those transitional power points rather than observed speed were then assigned the integer warp factors. These transitional points were established to apply to the original warp scale as well in the canonical warp chart.</p><p>This scale change occurred in 2312. A term was added to the above equation that caused the speed to rise slightly at lower warp factor, but to become infinite at warp 10. The ratio v/c at a given warp factor is equal to the corresponding cochrane value that describes the subspace distortion.<br>
For warp factors up to 9, the revised formula became:<br><br>
<code>wf=vc√103</code>
<br>with<p>
<ul>
<li>v being the speed of the signal or starship</li>
<li>c being the speed of light (3.0 × 108 m/s) and</li>
<li>wf being the resulting warp factor</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, to calculate speed in terms of c (up to warp 9), the formula would be:<br><br>
<code>speed=wf103c</code></p><p>In this case, warp 1 is equivalent to c (as it was in the 23rd century scale), but above warp 9 the speed increases exponentially, approaching infinity as the warp factor approaches 10.

<section id="Phasers" class="main-section"><header>Phasers</header>
<p>The <a href="https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Phaser"><abbr title="PHASed Energy Rectification">PHASER</abbr></a> is a standard weapon that has been issued to Starfleet personnel since the 23rd century.</p>
<p>Phasers project subatomic-particle beams (technically, nadions) which produce a wide variety of effects, ranging from Stun (technically, bioelectric shock) to Vaporization (technically, subatomic disruption).</p>
<p>Phasers can be fired in beams or pulses. They can also be set on Overload to detonate like mines or grenades.</p>
<p>Following a similar lineage to hand held weapons, starship phasers date their ancestry back to the 22nd century when Earth Starfleet introduced phase cannons. By the 23rd century these had developed into phaser banks which were fitted on most Starfleet vessels and could fire pulses and beams of phaser fire.</p>
<p>By the 24th century Starfleet vessels were as standard, fitted with phaser arrays, arrangements of phaser emitters positioned in strips along starships hulls to fire beams of phaser fire from all over the ship.</p>
<p>By the late 24th century, Starfleet phasers were capable of "thwarting" the creation of Tholian webs, however, the Tholians improved the web technology in order to be effective again.</p>
